                        <p>In the reading <a href="https://ulwazi.wits.ac.za/courses/49199/files/4500063?wrap=1">As we may think (Bush, 1979)</a>, the author relays criticism on older scientific research methods and developments of information, highlighting the now outdated and destructive developments that may have worked to sustain living conditions of the proletariat in the past, but not merely effective in creating reliable informative solutions for the future. <em>Dr. Bush</em> imposes an argument on how science has provided records of information that have been altered to highlight more of a one-sided approach to race rather than a broad spectrum of individuals. This leaves room for attention, where he imposes a challenge on modern scientists to come up with more effective and efficient developments for the better retention and extensions of information and knowledge systems. Despite the engagement of modern interests, the writer mentions how information has been fixed and mediated to almost eliminate our ability to dissect <strong>accurate records</strong>, as this was a common trend in the past. He continues to emphasize on how pre- and post-modern information systems must be thoroughly examined and engaged with for <strong>improved reliability</strong> of information. </p>

Prior to the introduction of HTML5, I would rely on my basic knowledge of HTML tags in previous years, but it is quite evident of how HTML 5 is helping to not only shape my knowledge and understanding of it, but at large understand the common algorithm or language rather that modern browsers and readers share in common when decoding structures of built modern websites today.</p>

                    <main>
                        <p>For the longest of time, I’ve battled with the difference between the article and section elements when it came to structuring my site’s body content and thanks to <em>Lawson</em> <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/01/html5-article-section/">(Lawson,2020)</a> who has helped clarify this confusion. It is interesting to know how these don’t differ much from each other as they are both sectioning elements whereas I can always keep in mind that the article tag will always be much preferred or rather more semantic to use when creating sections of content for my webpages. I am aware that the section element can be rarely used, for summary sections for example, accompanied by proper labeling arial tags for semantic value as well although it seems as though <em>Lawson</em> <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/01/html5-article-section/">(Lawson, 2020)</a> highly discourages this element’s use at all. </p>
                        <p>For the most part, I am now aware to always keep in mind the importance of using appropriate HTML5 tags/ elements for more reasons than I had expected. It is interesting to know how the use of properly nested headings, landmark regions and the overall use of semantic markup allows for efficient navigation and usability for not only visually able users, but the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/02/accessibility-webinar/">visually impaired</a> more especially as web readers can decode the structures of webpages using this semantic markup. I guess it is more important that a thorough execution of semantic markup is practiced for the best compatibility for web readers to decode any web structures of information. </p>

He defines semantic HTML as <strong>‘good’</strong> HTML, more or less choosing the appropriate HTML elements for our web content. With semantic HTML, web creators almost form a <strong>conventional DOM algorithm</strong> that makes modern sites easier to unpack or understand for readers. Since web pages are accessible using buttons, semantic HTML helps with the keyboard’s compatibility to ensure efficient navigation and browsing for the readers who would prefer using the keyboard. The appropriate linking of semantic labels with their input elements improves usability for mouse and touch-screen users for example, which also compliments good browsing and navigation for readers as well.  </p>

                        <p>Drawing from the this week’s technical lecture, I found my approach to designing my website being largely influenced and guided by the use of <strong>semantics</strong>. Getting a grasp on the right HTML tags to use, I found it quicker and easier to structure my content in whatever way I would like to. Clearly, HTML isn’t as scarry as I thought it would turn out to be. More importantly, I understand that a good semantic HTML application will create room for good CSS application as well when I insert my id and class elements. </p>

                    </header>
                    <main>
                        <p><a href="https://ulwazi.wits.ac.za/courses/49199/files/4500159?wrap=1">(Mailloux, 2015)</a> on <em>Convention and Context</em> shares interesting ideas around the interrelationship of <strong>context</strong> and its influence on <strong>conventional behaviour</strong>. In my understanding, context as a common factor, firstly, outlines the communal shared behaviours that form traditional conventions. In this context, it is evident that conventional behaviours are influenced by the shocking value of certain practices of value to groups of individuals in society, where these are then repeated to form sets of cultural practices and therefore forming these conventional behaviours.  </p>
                        <p>Theorist, <strong><em>Margaret Gilbert</em></strong>, then argues against this theory, stating that conventional behaviour is not always fixed or one dimensional, giving insight into the differing situations or contexts that influence behaviour. Simply, different contexts will always trigger certain actions for people to carry out depending on varying situations and therefore the fixed repetition of traditional behaviours cannot always apply to these varying contexts, according to Gilbert. Furthermore, theorist Paul Alpers then imposes a different scenario, where in the absence of context, he outlines that nonconventional behaviours will always occur as people would rather act out naturally based on instinct and natural cognition rather than following sets of rules that may not be accommodative or relational to their contextual states. These non-conventional behaviours then bring us closer to understanding the loopholes that occur and exist in the study of context and convention. </p>
                        <p>To try and bridge such gaps, Mailloux introduces us to interpretation and how it works to help us understand the influence of context towards convention through the making of meaning of texts. He outlines context as a limiting factor in text, stating how the decoding and meaning making of texts will always rely on more than one contextual feature. One example is where he states that the strategic conventions of decoding certain texts will always rely on previous conventions applied to previous texts with their own contexts as well. It is then evident that context on its own is very vital when it comes to forming conventions and it only makes sense that more and more conventions are yet to form as the world continues to evolve, introducing varying contexts in not just the text field, but in many other aspects of life as well. </p>

                    <main>
                        <p>In the study and of UI and UX, we witness the relationship between <strong>conventions, context and behaviour</strong>. When applying semantics, we follow a fixed structural code format that allows for compatibility with most browsers and this is a good example of a <strong>traditional practice</strong>, even though it has evolved through the years. We can observe such a contrast from the past and recent CSS lectures where both lecturers apply their own conventional knowledge of teaching in these two different contexts of differing years. Using the same conventional code format, we can then formulate our own web ‘conventions’ when applying our different styles and interest in our web designs. As we craft our custom interfaces, we apply our own conventions which are influenced by our own contextual ideas in attempt to prompt our desired user experiences. </p>

                        <p>Continuing from last week’s lecture on CSS fundamentals, I’ve had to start designing my website to fit my desired look and feel. The lecture helped to sharpen my knowledge of some key styling concepts and their <strong>semantic affordances</strong>, which would come very handy when creating my website. At first, I thought I could just design a cool theme and style it however I wanted to, but I’ve had to change my entire approach understanding that there are some <strong>UI conventions</strong> to be applied as well when designing. I’ve had to think of how and why I am designing this site, with the end goal of trying to achieve a simply accessible interface with efficient navigation tools for the end user to perhaps enjoy browsing through content on my site. </p>

                    </header>
                    <main>
                        <p>More than creating a good looking and appealing site, I’ve had to focus more on how I wanted my user interface to provide an efficient browsing experience for my end user. With an introduction to vital <a href="https://ulwazi.wits.ac.za/courses/49199/files/4850568?wrap=1">basic principles of UI design</a> , my approach has now been more cautious where I’m applying some very key conventions to make my site isn’t only easily accessible, but consistent in its design with the aid of a consistent visual <strong>display structure, consistent typography, logical navigation tools and icons</strong>strong> common to the everyday user, together with appropriate hyperlinking and navigation between information sections of my web page. With the help of Javascript, I am more excited to practice as many techniques to spark a more responsive interface with cool, yet simple and logical elements that provide immediate feedback to the user. </p>
                        <p>From an overall perspective, I guess the whole idea is to apply key <strong>UI conventions</strong> to achieve an interface design that has enough and simple affordances for a user. Most of the basic UI design principles all try to aim for <strong>simplicity, clarity</strong> and avoiding any <strong>unnecessary actions</strong> that would make it difficult for users to browse through a site. For the most part, my site should be able to provide enough interactive UI elements that my end users can simply identify and use for an efficient UX without much trivial effort. </p>

                        <p>In the reading <i>What is Design?</i> by <strong><em>Papanek</em></strong> <a href="https://ulwazi.wits.ac.za/courses/49199/files/4500160?wrap=1">(Papanek, 1984)</a>, he caught my attention with his interesting explanatation on the concept of design. He mentions how design can <strong>exist as a reflection of anything man wishes to create or exist beyond our understanding in natural form</strong>, like plants and animals, but to what extent can we really accept design as design? The author touches on how tying order to design in a way that it has <strong>intent and purpose</strong> would give it more meaning and value. So, design must have some purpose in a way that it can be understood or become cognitive to the next person. This is another way I can make sure that my site’s UI has some sort of structure, accompanied by cognitive visual elements that altogether provoke certain actions for my end user.  </p>

                        <p>In this reading, co-authors <em><a href="https://ulwazi.wits.ac.za/courses/49199/files/4500169?wrap=1">Hassenzahl and Tractinsky</a></em> , introduce us to interesting ideas around the notion of UX, which is quite a diverse phenomenon with a wide range of meanings. Due to UX’s lack of empirical research, these many ideas bring us closer to a common idea, which is the aim to achieve <strong>leasurable usability</strong>p from users. The authors share three different approaches to understanding UX; understanding a product design’s <strong>instrumental needs</strong> and the <strong>non-instrumental</strong> in relation to affecting positive emotion and creating <strong>experiences</strong> through design. Traditional and work-based usability seems to be more narrow when trying to decode UX, where primal focus to a user’s engagement with a product or design allows room for more attention since technology does affect the user after all. Users have different needs and agendas when interacting with tech-systems and on the contrary, technology does somehow offer some pragmatic value to its user. Whether you are looking to complete a work-related task, trying to communicate with loved ones or even looking for fun and entertainment, I guess what is more important, as highlighted by Hassenzahl and Tractinsky, is the <strong>positive emotion</strong> that should be accompanied by interactive usability despite any user’s mood at any given time and context. For any experience that comes with tech usability as well, an achievement of positive affection on the user allows room for even better usability developments which should not only seek to solve problems by designers, but look to stimulate an overall pleasurable aesthetic for users. </p>

                        <p><strong>Goal Alignment</strong> – For my website, I am looking to produce an interface of overall simplicity through a consistent display style with easy navigation as well. Not so much of a very aesthetically pleasing and decorated site for now, but more of a simple layout with basic HTML and CSS application. My primal focus is to achieve good <strong>semantic recognition</strong> and <strong>theory content evaluation</strong> from my user for now, then look to develop my interface for more aesthetic impressions in the next submission perhaps. This should be achievable with the inclusion of Javascript as I continue to develop my interface.  </p>
                        <p><strong>Information Structure</strong> – So far, I’ve looked to provide sections of blogpost content where these are all located on one page and can be easily accessed through drop-down buttons. Each blogpost features articles with hierarchies of content presented through <strong>headings, bold texts, font sizes, and hyperlinks</strong> to capture vital and the least vital information as well. Each page more or less has a simple layout of information with easy navigation as well.  </p>
                        <p><strong>User flow</strong> - The home page features a menu with page sections the user may choose to visit <strong>>>></strong> The blog section appears first and provides blog sections that the user can view single-handedly, one at a time, while being able to quickly switch to another quite easily. <strong>>>></strong> The user can scroll up and down to read through all blogpost window sections. The window/ content sections allow for a quick read and a quick transitions when switching from one post to another <strong>>>></strong> Other sections on the menu can be accessed as well and each menu is highlighted when currently active.  </p>
                        <p><strong>Interface Elements and Semiotics</strong> – So far, I have only applied few basic navigation icons, such as the <strong>drop-down buttons</strong> to unveil blogpost content including <strong>menu buttons</strong> to display page content. Blogpost content has distinctive information which is visible through important highlighted and bold texts, hyperlinks and least important content appearing in smaller text.  </p>
                        <p><strong>More future improvements</strong> - I should look to add more navigation elements with more relative references across pages as I look to add more content on the pages. I am to improve my interface’s accessibility as well, to make it is compatible across multiple devices as I look to master my CSS fundamentals. With Javascript included, I will look to achieve quicker navigation and infuse more interactive content elements as well. </p>
